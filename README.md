# SMTB - Semantic UI Bootstrap
## Introdution
SMTB is a Bootstrap theme and component collections inspired by Semantic UI. It rely on bootstrap 3 but some of new added components can be used independently. SMTB didn't merged with the bootstrap soruce, so you can use most version of bootstrap 3 as a base and overide the style by adding SMTB css after bootstrap source css. (i.e. You can use a customized bootstrap package as a base)
